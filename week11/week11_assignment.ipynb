Diabetes is a chronic condition that requires ongoing care, and hospitals are often involved in programs aimed at improving patient outcomes, such as reducing complications, hospital readmissions, and managing blood sugar levels. By tracking key metrics like participation start and end dates, as well as patient denominators, healthcare organizations can assess the effectiveness of these programs over time and make data-driven decisions to improve care delivery.\n",

Furthermore, aggregating data on the number of patients involved (denominators) helps quantify the scope of each hospitalâ€™s efforts in managing diabetes. This information can be used for performance benchmarking, identifying best practices, and allocating resources more effectively. Overall, the project would be valuable for healthcare administrators and policymakers aiming to enhance the quality of care for diabetic patients while ensuring that healthcare facilities are consistently meeting program goals.\n",
