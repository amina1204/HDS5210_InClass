Your midterm presents a big problem - I am not sure that you understand how functions work. 
You created in the first steps mostly correct implementations of the bode scores. 
Your Dyspnea is slightly off, but within reason.
Then you created dummy implementations of the functions in the last steps that overrode the correct implementations.
So your data in the files is not remotely close.
